The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a nested element might not produce the expected result because the `100%` refers to the parent's size, not the element's own size. Another example is mixing different units without proper conversion, such as `calc(50% + 10em)`.
